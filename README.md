# rock-paper-scissors
This project is to create a rock paper scissors game against a computer, which in it's starting stages has no GUI, but instead is played in the console. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the ability to create a program with Javascript. The extension of this project entails adding a user interface. After completing the extension of the project, I will have demonstrated HTML and CSS skills as well as more advanced JS skills and the ability to link javascript and HTML elements.
